repair <file> compresses <file> by generating <file>.[CR]
not a real compressor as it generates integers for .C and .R, but it
gives some statistics on what could be obtained if coding them with log|R|
bits, and can be used for different purposes.

despair <file> (re)generates <file> from <file>.[CR]

irepair, idespair: same but expect sequences of integers not chars

toint <file> converts chars to ints, to test irepair/idespair
